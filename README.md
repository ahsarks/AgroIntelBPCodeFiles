AgroIntel Cattle Monitoring â€“ Project Files Overview

This repository contains the main components of the AgroIntel cattle monitoring system. Below is a brief description of each file:

AgroIntel_YOLOV8TrainModel.ipynb  
Trains a YOLOv8 object detection model to identify and localize cows in barn video frames using a labeled dataset. Includes data loading, training configuration, model evaluation, and saving the trained weights.

Detection_Tracking.py  
Performs real-time detection and tracking of cows using the trained YOLOv8 model along with the ByteTrack algorithm. It logs cow positions, assigns consistent IDs, tracks time in different barn zones, and uploads data to Firebase.

AgroIntel_Feature_Extraction_Analysis.ipynb  
Processes tracked cow movement data to extract behavioral features such as speed, total distance traveled, number of stops, time spent in eating/sleeping zones, and zone transitions for each cow.

AgroIntel_Sickness_Estrus_Prediction_Model.ipynb  
Trains and evaluates a machine learning model to predict whether a cow is healthy, sick, or in estrus (heat) with synthetic data, based on extracted behavioral features.
